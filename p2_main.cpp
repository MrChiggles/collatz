/*
 Performs the Collatz sequence.
 Returns the total track count of a inputs sequence.
 The Collatz sequence performs two seperate operations based on a number being even or odd.
 If odd the number is tripled and one is added, if not it is halved.
 This process is repeated until one is reached.
 Convergence to one has been proven for all real numbers above zero and less than 2^60.
